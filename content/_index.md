ADD PROFILE IMAGE AND MY NAME UNDERNEATH

Hi! I'm a 2nd year [Engineering Science](notes/University/EngSci.md) student at the University of Toronto. My interests and hobbies include [Deep Learning](deep%20learning/deep%20learning.md), [Electronics and Microcontroller Projects](personal%20projects/electronics.md), [Computer Hardware](computer%20building/computer%20building), [Golf](hobbies/golf,md), and [Valorant](hobbies/valorant.md).

The purpose of this website is to provide a glimpse into several aspects of myself from my professional career to my random activities on a Sunday afternoon. 

## Ways to Navigate the Website 
Here, you'll find everything from my [resume](professional/resume.md) and [portfolio](professional/portfolio.md) to [personal projects](personal projects/electronics), [written tutorials](personal projects/tutorials), [school notes](notes/lecture.md), and even blogs and random snippets of content. <-- link this now

There are three main ways of navigating this website.
1. At the bottom of every webpage, there is an interactive graph that links every webpage to each other. Any type of graph-traversal algorithm may be used to search the website. 
2. While reading articles, there are several hyperlinks which each lead to their own webpage regarding the topic. One could play a game of [The Wiki Game](https://www.thewikigame.com/) to delve deeper and deeper into some [obscure corner of my spleen](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/37695/forgetfulness).
3. On the bottom of the main webpage, there is a section that outlines my most recent posts.
